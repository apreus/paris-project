                Dedication: "To our lady of Paris in recognition of graces granted." "Our Lady of Paris," both the Virgin Mary
                and the cathedral dedicated to her on the Ile-de-la-Cite, at the center of Paris, with an echo of the prayer
                "Ave Maria, gratia piena" ("Hail Mary, full of grace"——see line 445). The frame suggests that of a votive plaque
                such as might be hung in a church. From the outset, Paris is addressed as a woman.

                    depicts her as tall and slender, a pyramid, resembling both the Eiffel Tower and Gambetta's monument. Red ribbons in her hair and on her dress echo his red
                    stud. She seems drugged, and, like him, is pointing, in her case to a small (Maltese) dog at her feet, as if directing the Magi to the infant Jesus at
                    Epiphany. HM and JH may have seem this painting in Madrid in 1916; Goya was fashionable with the French avant-garde.

                    445-46. The poem ends with the constellation of Ursa Major, the great she-bear, part of the private code between HM and JH, who sometimes signed off letters
                    to HM with this star-sign in reverse.

                    On the final page, HM makes a further highly original gesture by providing a set of notes to her admittedly difficult poem. Though not without precedent
                    (Pope had annotated his "Dunciad"), it was unusual for an author to annotate her own text thus. Brief and fragmentary though her notes are, they offer a
                    fresh perspective on the poem, and incidentally anticipate T. S. Eliot's use of notes in <hi rendition="#italic">The Waste Land</hi> (1922).
